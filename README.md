# QticTacToe
## A simple python game of TicTacToe with a GUI
Originally coded for a computing class, this project started out as a simple terminal game with code frankesteined from 3 of us. It was then taken over by @RallyCorder for continued learning. The game was mainly developed as an exercise, as well as to learn to work with the Qt framework.

## Requirements
- `python 3.2`
- `qt6`

## Functionnalities
- fully interactive interface with precise functions
- support for usernames
- a leaderboard file for the default symbols and players
- tab controls for keyboard only users

## Endnotes
*The PDF was instructions for the legacy version of the game, containing certain restrictions. Feel free to modify the code as you wish, for example to change the symbols. And have fun :}*
